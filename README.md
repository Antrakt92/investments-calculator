## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 19 tests for CGT Calculator (matching rules, exemption, losses)
- 26 tests for Exit Tax Calculator (classification, deemed disposal, FIFO)
- Parser tests (regex patterns, number normalization)

## 💰 Tax Rules Implemented

### CGT (Capital Gains Tax) - 33%
- **Annual exemption**: €1,270
- **Irish matching rules** (NOT FIFO like Trade Republic uses):
  1. Same-day acquisitions
  2. Acquisitions within next 4 weeks (bed & breakfast rule)
  3. FIFO for remaining shares
- **Payment deadlines**:
  - Gains Jan-Nov: Due December 15
  - Gains December: Due January 31

### Exit Tax - 41%
- Applies to Irish/EU domiciled funds (ISIN: IE, LU, DE, FR, etc.)
- **Deemed disposal every 8 years** from purchase
- **No annual exemption**
- Losses CAN offset gains within Exit Tax regime
- Losses CANNOT offset CGT gains (separate regime)

### DIRT - 33%
- Applies to interest income (Trade Republic cash interest)
- **Trade Republic doesn't withhold** - must self-declare
- No exemption

## 📋 Form 11 Guidance

The calculator provides mappings to Revenue Form 11 fields:

| Form 11 Section | What to Report |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Panel D** | Deposit Interest (DIRT) |
| **Panel E** | Capital Gains, Exit Tax on funds |
| **Panel F** | Foreign Dividends |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Trade Republic vs Irish Tax Rules

Trade Republic uses **FIFO** for calculating gains. However, Irish CGT uses different matching rules. This calculator **recalculates all gains** using the correct Irish rules.

### Exit Tax vs CGT

| Asset Type | ISIN Prefix | Tax Rate | Exemption |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| EU ETFs/Funds | IE, LU, DE, FR | 41% Exit Tax | None |
| US ETFs | US | 33% CGT | €1,270 |
| Individual Stocks | Any | 33% CGT | €1,270 |

### DIRT Reminder

Trade Republic pays interest but does **NOT** withhold Irish DIRT. You must self-declare this on Form 11.
