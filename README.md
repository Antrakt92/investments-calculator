## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 19 tests for CGT Calculator (matching rules, exemption, losses)
- 26 tests for Exit Tax Calculator (classification, deemed disposal, FIFO)
- Parser tests (regex patterns, number normalization)

## 💰 Tax Rules Implemented

### CGT (Capital Gains Tax) - 33%
- **Annual exemption**: €1,270
- **Irish matching rules** (NOT FIFO like Trade Republic uses):
  1. Same-day acquisitions
  2. Acquisitions within next 4 weeks (bed & breakfast rule)
  3. FIFO for remaining shares
- **Payment deadlines**:
  - Gains Jan-Nov: Due December 15
  - Gains December: Due January 31

### Exit Tax - 41%
- Applies to Irish/EU domiciled funds (ISIN: IE, LU, DE, FR, etc.)
- **Deemed disposal every 8 years** from purchase (tracked with urgency alerts)
- **No annual exemption**
- Losses CAN offset gains within Exit Tax regime
- Losses CANNOT offset CGT gains (separate regime)
- Dashboard widget shows upcoming deemed disposals with time remaining

### DIRT - 33%
- Applies to interest income (Trade Republic cash interest)
- **Trade Republic doesn't withhold** - must self-declare
- No exemption

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Upload
- `POST /upload/trade-republic-pdf` - Upload and parse PDF
- `POST /upload/debug-pdf` - Debug parsing without saving
- `DELETE /upload/clear-data` - Clear all data

### Portfolio
- `GET /portfolio/holdings` - Current holdings with cost basis
- `GET /portfolio/transactions` - Transaction history
- `GET /portfolio/income` - Interest and dividends
- `POST /portfolio/transactions` - Add transaction
- `PUT /portfolio/transactions/{id}` - Edit transaction
- `DELETE /portfolio/transactions/{id}` - Delete transaction

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Mode

Family Mode allows tracking investments separately for each person (e.g., husband and wife):

### Setup
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Add your name and optionally add spouse/partner
3. Each person can have a distinct color for easy identification

### How It Works
- **Upload**: When uploading PDFs, select whose transactions they belong to
- **Portfolio**: Filter holdings, transactions, and income by person
- **Tax Calculator**: Calculate taxes per person (each gets €1,270 CGT exemption) or combined view

### Benefits
- Each person gets their own annual CGT exemption (€1,270 each)
- Track investments separately while filing joint Form 11
- Color-coded UI for quick identification

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Trade Republic vs Irish Tax Rules

Trade Republic uses **FIFO** for calculating gains. However, Irish CGT uses different matching rules. This calculator **recalculates all gains** using the correct Irish rules.

### Exit Tax vs CGT

| Asset Type | ISIN Prefix | Tax Rate | Exemption |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| EU ETFs/Funds | IE, LU, DE, FR | 41% Exit Tax | None |
| US ETFs | US | 33% CGT | €1,270 |
| Individual Stocks | Any | 33% CGT | €1,270 |

### DIRT Reminder

Trade Republic pays interest but does **NOT** withhold Irish DIRT. You must self-declare this on Form 11.
